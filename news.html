        From everything that has been revealed in the Deadpool & Wolverine trailers, there are a number of reasons why the Phase 5 installment is looking to be better than recent MCU films. To begin with, Deadpool & Wolverine is tapping into a long-time dream among Marvel fans as Hugh Jackman's Logan will finally get to team up with Wade, especially after how bad the first attempt was in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Even if it is a Wolverine variant, it is still setting up an adventure that many will want to see in theaters.

<br>
<br>
Deadpool & Wolverine is also leaning into a different era of Marvel movies, as this film is bidding farewell to 20th Century Fox's time with the brand. With returning X-Men characters, Jennifer Garner's Elektra, and other surprises that are bound to get a positive response, it is fan service at its finest. Deadpool & Wolverine is also the first time Marvel Studios is giving the audience an R-rated film, which has been highly demanded for years.
<br>
<br>
Since this will also allow Deadpool to be in the MCU on a permanent basis, it will be fun to see how he engages with characters like The Avengers. Time will tell what other secrets Deadpool & Wolverine has in store for the audience. But with only two more months left to go, the world will know soon enough what is coming up in Deadpool & Wolverine.
